# projetGraphe
2 graphs projects using python

## Project maze
A maze that is created randomly and then solved by finding the shortest path between the top-left corner and the bottom-right corner using Dijkstra algorithm<br>
Requirements : python with modules random, networkx and pygame

## Project bice
A graph composed of graphs that represents the urban bice network of Belfort<br>
The programm permits to find the shortest path between 2 bice stops using Dijkstra algorithm, but it doesn't consider distances between bice stops, nor marching between to bice stops to shorten the distance, nor the time between the bice stops<br>
Requirements : python with modules graphviz, networkx, tkinter<br>
Image of the bice network (represented by graphviz, doesn't correspond to the real one)
